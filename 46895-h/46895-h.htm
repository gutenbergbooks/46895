<h2>SCRAPS FROM CHAPS.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">The Irish Yolk.</span>&mdash;In the
name of the Profit&mdash;eggs!
Irish co-operators have already
made giant strides in the production
of milk and butter, and
now the Irish Co-operative
Agency has decided, so says the
<i>Cork Daily Herald</i>, to "take
up the egg-trade." We hope
the egg-traders won't be
"taken up," too; if so, the
trade would be arrested just
when it was starting, and where
would the profit be then?
"It is stated that many Irish
eggs now reach the English
market dirty, stale, and unsorted,"
so that wholesale
English egg-merchants have
preferred to buy Austrian and
French ones. Ireland not able
to compete with the foreigner!
Perish the thought! A little
technical education judiciously
applied will soon teach the Irish
fowl not to lay "shop 'uns."</p>

<h3>Feathers in Scotch Caps.</h3>

<blockquote><p>
"The railway race to the North,
like the race across the Atlantic,
has placed beyond challenge that
on land as well as on sea Scotch
engines break the record."&mdash;<i>North
British Daily Mail.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Did not Lord <span class="sc">Byron</span> anticipate
this when he wrote (in
<i>Mr. Punch's</i> version of his
poem on "Dark Lochnagar"):&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem width24">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Yes, Caledonia, thy engines <i>are</i> scrumptious,</p>
<p class="i2">Though even in England some good ones are seen;</p>
<p>And, if the confession won't render you bumptious,</p>
<p class="i2">We sigh for your flyers to far Aberdeen!</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>But if Caledonia is inclined
to boast about its locomotives,
let it ponder its tinkers, and
learn humility. The Glasgow
"Departmental Committee on
Habitual Offenders, Vagrants,
&amp;c.," reports that the nomad
tinkers of Scotland number
1702, and of these 232 "were
apprehended for some crime or
other during the year." <i>They</i>
don't do 151 miles in 167
minutes, like the locomotives&mdash;no,
they do a couple of
months in Glasgow gaol; and
they break the laws instead of
breaking records. There are
725 tinker children, who get
practically no education. Bonnie
Scotland, land of grandeur,
where the thousand tinkers
wander, you must catch these
children, and educate them!
The adult tinker may be irreclaimable,
but at least the
children should have a chance
of something better&mdash;a choice
of being soldier, sailor, tinker,
or tailor, as they prefer. If,
after all, they elect to tink,
tink they must.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dr. John Rhys</span>, of Jesus
College, Oxford, quite rose to
the occasion at the New Quay,
Eisteddfod, and, in his presidential
address, made lengthy
quotations in Welsh. "Na
chaib a rhaw" must mean
"nor cares a rap." By the
way, the <i>South Wales Daily
News</i>, in reporting the proceedings,
finishes up by declaring
that "the speech was
listened to with '<i>wrapt</i>' attention."
As Mrs. <span class="sc">Malaprop</span> remarked,
"The parcel was enraptured
in brown paper."</p>

<h2>ROBERT UNDER THE GREENWOOD TREE.</h2>

<p>Me and a werry old Frend of mine has seized the hoppertoonity
that ardly ever okkers to too frends as has little or nothink to do for
a hole week, to thurrowly enjoy theirselves for that time, and see
weather sutten places in our little world is reelly as butiful and as
injoyable as sum peeple tries to make
out as they is. Our fust place was
Epping Forrest, where we spent a hole
day from morning to nite in what my
frend called such a gallaxy of buty
and wunder as werry likely werry few
peeple ever has injoyd as we did. We
spent hole miles among the most butiful
Forest Trees as was ever seed, every
single tree of which was rather more
butiful than the last, and not one of
which but what was a reel bootiful
studdy. It took us jest about two
hours to eat our dinner afore we set
to work again to pollish off the lovely
trees we had not yet seen; and then,
when we had pollished off the last of
them, we staggered to our werry last
carridge, and took the sleep of the
Just, and did not wake up till Brekfust come kindly to our assistance,
and helped us to sett out and try again to dishcover similar
seens of delishus injoyment to those so marwellusly injoyed the day
before!</p>

<p>The trees as we xamined on the secund day was quite a diffrent
class to them on the fust, and emused us every bit as delifefully as
the fust sett, tho they was quite a diffrent sett altogether. In
won place we drove bang into the wery middel of the thickest wood,
and there we both lost ourselves for nearly three ours, but it wasn't
a minnet too much for us, for we both agreed that, upon the hole, it
was about the werry loveliest part of the hole day's proceedens, and
that we shoud not regret havin to repeat it the next day. Oh them
hundereds and thowsends of lovely Trees! every one of which seems
far more butiful than the last, and quite equal to any we had yet seen.
At one place we was showed the place where Good Quean <span class="sc">Alizebeth</span>
always went up stairs on Orseback, coz she did not like going
up stairs in public. At another we was showed where the present
<span class="sc">Queen</span> sat in her privet Carridge, and made the hole nayberhood
bow to her by the hunderd. <span class="sc">Tom</span> and Me both went up to the werry
place, and pinted it out to them as didn't kno it, which made us both
feel werry grand. The werry next day we had made all our derangements
for follering up our prewius wisitashun, and making a grand
fi-nayle of the hole lovely affare, when, to our tremenjus disapintment,
the wind begun for to blow most orfully, and the rain begun
for to rain wus as I beleeves, and as <span class="sc">Tom</span> beleeves, than ewer it did
afore, and so we was both obleeged for to leeve our truly lovely
forests, and defer our tree climing till a much more drier hoppertoonity,
which we both bleeves will appear in about a week, and then
we shall renew our grand old wisit as before, and lern again to
beleeve in our hundereds and thowsends of the most buteful trees as
ewen old hingland can brag about, as the most lovelyest as the
world ewer saw.</p>

<p>And to think that all the lovely places as we seed in them three
lovely days is past and gorn for the present, makes us long only the
more artily for the glorius days still in store for us!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Sergeant-Major</span> and Mrs. <span class="sc">Baker</span> were one of a trio of couples
successful in winning their claim to the prize of a flitch of bacon at
Dunmow. Three hundred and sixty-six days of married life without
a flitch&mdash;we should say, hitch&mdash;in the flow of amicable intercourse
is, nowadays, a marvellous achievement, and merits due recognition.
We, however, commiserate the gallant and hambitions sergeant-major
on having his matrimonial intentions aspersed by the opposing
counsel, who, in attempting to "save the bacon," suggested that
"<span class="sc">Baker</span> had one eye on the lady and the other eye on the flitch."
The prospect of a reward even "more lasting than ham" would
hardly, it is to be feared, serve to keep ordinary couples from "tiffs"
for the space of a year and a day continuously.</p>

<h2 class="sans">THE NEARLY REACHED SHILLING.</h2>

<p class="title1">(<i>A School-Board Chronicle.</i>)</p>

<p>"Utterly impossible!" replied the official.
"A good plain cook! No, the Board does not
create persons of that kind. If you had wanted
a <i>chef</i> for a club, or a <i>cordon bleu</i> for a West
End hotel, we might have accommodated you.
But a good plain cook! No&mdash;utterly impossible!"</p>

<p>"But surely cookery is taught in the
schools," pleaded the Ratepayer.</p>

<p>"Assuredly. And very well taught too.
But whom would be satisfied with a mutton-chop?
We aim at something higher. Our
scholars are equal to producing <i>sole à gratin</i>,
or <i>suprême de volaille</i>. And you don't require
those <i>plats</i> every day of your life, now
do you?"</p>

<p>"Then, can I have a housemaid?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid not. Since music has become
one of the recognised branches of study, we
do not obtain many candidates for the task of
stair-sweeping. And it is not surprising. A
girl who can play the piano, or lead a chorus,
is surely worthy of a better fate than that
which usually falls to the lot of a servant in
a middle-class establishment."</p>

<p>"I suppose it is useless to ask you if you
can give me the name of a boy in buttons?"</p>

<p>"Quite. To tell you the truth, we do not
encourage such appointments. Our lads are
wanted at their studies until they are growing
too old to be young pages. Then, when
they have reached the required standard their
literary attainments entitle them to something
superior to the post of a drudge in the
pantry."</p>

<p>"Then what do you propose doing with
your charges?" asked the Ratepayer, who
was rapidly becoming resigned to his position.</p>

<p>"Well, our <i>chefs</i> must wait until the time
arrives when there will be enough clubs and
West End hotels to secure the benefit of their
services."</p>

<p>"And the musicians?"</p>

<p>"They, too, at present are rather a drug
in the market. But who knows? Some day
there may be a huge demand for pianoforte
players."</p>

<p>"And the literary lads?"</p>

<p>"Most admirably adapted for clerkships,
but the clerical labour market is as dull as
the proverbial ditchwater. Still, things may
revive. But for the present they must hope
and wait."</p>

<p>"And I provide the funds for all this?"
cried the Ratepayer.</p>

<p>"You do," returned the official promptly.
"This year it will be elevenpence halfpenny
in the pound, and next probably considerably
higher. But then you see&mdash;<i>it is quite worth
the money!</i>"</p>

<h2 class="sans">A LITTLE HOLIDAY.</h2>

<p class="title1">(<i>By Our Own Enterprising Explorer.</i>)</p>

<p>"Why not go to Amsterdam?" At first sight this conundrum
had the customary couple of answers, "No time, no money." But
these were incorrect solutions.</p>

<p>"My dear Sir," said the Secretary of a Society organised to bring
happiness into the humblest home (pronunciation with or without
aspirates, according to the taste of the speaker), taking me up
smartly, "you can get there in less than no time, remain there
less than no time, and be back in less than no time. We can
manage that for you."</p>

<p>"But the expense?"</p>

<p>"We should not be a Society organised to bring happiness into
the humblest home if we could not manage that also. Look here:
start Day 1 at 6.30 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>; be in Amsterdam morning of Day 2.
Pause of thirty-six hours for refreshment; then back again to
London in time for breakfast on Day 4. And with a view to bringing
happiness into the humblest home we charge a guinea for
travelling expenses, which includes a state cabin in the saloon of
an excellent boat."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;"><a href="images/088-430.png"><img src="images/088-200.png" width="200" height="249" alt="'That characteristic movement'" /></a>
<p>"That characteristic movement
in sea produced more
gravity than gaiety amongst
the passengers."</p></div>

<p>So I closed with the Secretary, and brought away happiness to my
humble home. On the whole that
happiness was maintained. It is true
that the excellent boat was rather
leisurely in her movements. I went
to the Hook of Holland in a gale,
which was kind enough to wait for my
return off the Dutch coast, and accompany
me back to the white cliffs
of Albion. The excellent boat seemed
to be on quite friendly terms with this
gale, and to enjoy its company. Instead
of flying from shore to shore,
after the fashion of other steamers, the
excellent boat toyed with each wave,
lingered languidly amongst every
billow, and arrived at her destination,
both coming and going, several hours
late. She appeared during the voyages
to keenly appreciate a characteristic
movement in sea. That characteristic
movement in sea produced more gravity
than gaiety amongst the passengers.
Leaving the excellent boat out of the question&mdash;which boat, by the
way, would no doubt have been more than excellent <i>minus</i> the
gale&mdash;the journey "there and back" was accomplished with comfort
and despatch.</p>

<p>On my arrival at Amsterdam I found myself in a city that, in its
main characteristics, was not entirely unlike Brixton. The shops and
the people were both suggestive of the southern suburb. The trams
that, according to the guide-books, "traversed the town in every
direction," were also reminiscent of that delightful haven of rest
(from Saturday to Monday) of the overworked stockbroker and the
underworked Government <i>employé</i>.</p>

<p>"You are sure to like Amsterdam," a friend of mine had said, as
he pressed my hand at parting, "because it's exactly like the
Regent's Park Canal."</p>

<p>My friend was right. Amsterdam certainly resembles the Regent's
Park Canal, but <i>plus</i> Brixton. No doubt it is for this reason that it
is sometimes called "the Northern Venice." The people, too, had a
suburban look about them. I felt sure that most of them were called
<span class="sc">Smith</span>, <span class="sc">Brown</span>, <span class="sc">Jones</span>, and <span class="sc">Robinson</span>, with
perhaps a conventional
"dam" tacked on to the end of their names to show that by
nationality they were Dutchmen. I approached one of these good,
honest creatures, who looked like <span class="sc">Smithdam</span>, and in my best
broken English asked for the Hotel Amstel. I pronounced the latter
word as if the last syllable rhymed with "peal." Mr. <span class="sc">Smithdam</span>
stared at me and shook his head. Then he said "Nine."</p>

<p>"'Otel Amstale," I continued, with a new pronunciation. "You
know what mean I&mdash;'Otel Amstale?"</p>

<p>But Mr. <span class="sc">Smithdam</span> didn't. He smiled, and again shook his
head. This annoyed me, so I murmured, "What an ass this chap
must be; fancy not knowing the way to the Amstel Hotel!"</p>

<p>"Amstel Hotel," he cried, with a pronunciation infinitely more
English than my own, and then most courteously gave me the route.
I thanked him with effusion, and most probably should have found
his directions of infinite value had he but delivered them in English
instead of Dutch. As it was, I put myself into a London-looking
cab (the driver very properly wore a military cockade), and was soon
at one of the best hostelries in Holland. Situation pleasant&mdash;of
course overlooking a canal&mdash;rooms comfortable, kitchen all that could
be desired.</p>

<p>And now what did I do in Amsterdam? Why, I went to the
Exhibition. And what was it like? Well, a Dutch edition of those
that had gone before. At the Naval display before the Royal
Hospital at Chelsea, there was a model of the <i>Victory</i>, with a
representation
in wax of the Death of Nelson. At Amsterdam there is a
model of a mail-boat, with a representation (in breathing humanity)
of people drinking beer.</p>

<p>At Paris there was a Tour Eiffel, with a magnificent view at the
summit; at Amsterdam there is a tower in the shape of a colossal
elephant, with a fine display on every floor of beer. At South Kensington
there was a realistic reproduction of Old London on temperance
principles. At Amsterdam there is a realistic reproduction
of Old Holland served with beer. Go where I would I ran across
beer. The grounds of the Exhibition were dotted with booths.
Before many of them were very decent orchestras discoursing sweet
music. But the foreigners were there not only to attend to the
music, but to drink beer. The Exhibition proper (contents small
and select, with few English exhibits) was not apparently much of
an attraction. I readily understood the reason&mdash;it was not devoted
exclusively to beer. In what I may term the Exhibition annex I
found any number of specimens of the oriental merchants in the
fezes, who were wont in the olden days to enhance the joys of
Olympia and Earl's Court.</p>

<p>"Come here, gentlemans," cried half a dozen in a breath, "I will
sell you this!"</p>

<p>But they didn't. Having done the exhibition and the admirable
museum, with its wonderful armour and marvellous old masters, I
sampled a music hall. I went to "the Crystal Palace" (vide guide-books),
a magnificent building, that no doubt had been built with
the highest aspirations and had come in the progress of time to the
loftiest tumblings. A portion of this noble institution had been converted
into a place of entertainment. Small stage with miniature
scenery, trapeze, orchestra. Audience almost entirely Dutch, entertainment
almost entirely English. Several British singers. One, a
gentleman in evening dress covered by a long Newmarket overcoat,
with a <i>répertoire</i> redolent of Holborn and the Surrey side, sang
about "Nine in a row" who (so I understood him to assert)
"rolled down the street" when (if I am not mistaken) they were
rather "rocky about their feet." Then he had another ditty which
referred to his want of value. Was he worth anything? He
appealed to the Dutch audience. Some of them (possibly friends of
the singer) replied in the negative. Then he expressed his conviction
that he ought to be chucked out. The spectators cheered,
and seemed well satisfied with the programme. Whether they were
able to appreciate all the topical allusions is open to doubt, but I am
certain that they were thoroughly enjoying their beer.</p>

<p>I went to the market. An enormous crowd surrounded one booth.
The salesman was singing a song in honour of his wares, which were
composed of pieces of broken iron! So far as I could understand the
manners and customs of the vendors, the golden rule seemed to be
amongst them, "When in doubt take off the door to the outhouse
with the three broken panes of glass, the back parlour chandelier that
lacks a chain, and the disused baby's cradle, and sell 'em all by
auction."</p>

<p>I looked in, of course, at the Cathedral. My guide could not speak
French, but he understood English. He showed me the tombs of
several admirals.</p>

<p>"Where is <span class="sc">Van Tromp</span>?" I asked, taking an interest in the career
of about the only Dutchman whose name I know intimately. Then,
to make it plainer, I added, "Whar is das <span class="sc">Van Tromp</span>?"</p>

<p>My guide turned up his nose contemptuously, and said something
(so far as I could comprehend him) about <span class="sc">Van Tromp</span> being in "de
odder kirsher." Later on, when I asked the use of a sort of vestry,
he murmured something about "Balaclava." From this I took it
that he could not make himself understood. But I was wrong. I
did not know much about the Dutch coinage. When I bought anything
I invariably kept my hand waiting for change until the supply
was exhausted. Sometimes I put forth my hand a second time with
the result of getting a few extra coins. There are guilders, little
pieces that look like a doll's silver pennies, and a showy coin that
suggests a sixpence in a decline. These latter are worth, I fancy,
about three halfpence a dozen. I gave the cathedral custodian one
of these sixpences in a decline. But it was not enough, not nearly
enough, so I exchanged it for a doll's silver penny, when he
beamed with gratitude.</p>

<p>Would that I could tell of the other attractions of Amsterdam, of
the Royal Palace, the Zoo, the theatres, and the canals. But exigencies
of time and space say "No." Those who want to see and
hear have only one thing to do. Let them hie to the Hook of
Holland, ho, to the Dutch capital, and further description will be
unnecessary.</p>

<p>During a severe thunderstorm at Bjelina, in Bosnia, according
to the <i>Pall Mall Gazette's</i> "Science Notes," there fell a remarkable

<h2>ROUNDABOUT READINGS.</h2>

<p>It is a great thing to know&mdash;and one must believe it if one
believes, as I do, in what the newspapers say&mdash;that every single male
member of the upper or fashionable ranks of society is at this moment
engaged in slaughtering grouse. It is of course well known that
every member of Parliament is, on his election, presented by a
grateful country with a large and well-stocked grouse-moor,
situated in one of the most picturesque and romantic parts of
Scotland, and no one (not even a brewer) is ever raised to the
peerage unless he can prove that at least three generations of his
family have shot grouse regularly on the 12th of August on a moor
of their own. Thus is the connection of both branches of our legislature
with sport safeguarded.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p class="ind1"><br />Whenever the 12th of August, or, for the
matter of that, the 1st of September or the 1st of
October, comes round with the revolving year, we
are informed in every newspaper that "Sportsmen
were early astir." There is about these words a
halo of tradition so ancient and venerable as to
have become almost sacred. Imagination conjures
up the picture of happy bands of shooters all duly
booted, gaitered, gunned, cartridged and cigarred,
sallying forth with dogs and keepers at 5 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>, no
doubt after eating, as condemned men do, a hearty
breakfast. Of course this may be so. I have read
it so often that I hardly dare to doubt it. My own
experience, however, is that sportsmen are not
specially early even on the 12th, although keepers
and other professional guns who cater for the
London market are often so early as to anticipate by more than a
few hours the recurring anniversary.</p>

<p>Where, though the birds be strong upon the wing,</p>

<p>Where dealing fate to feather (and to fur)</p>
<p>The early sportsman is perceived astir,</p>
<p>And in the lengthy language of the chase,</p>

<p>I am never irritable myself; I am sometimes justifiably annoyed
by the unreasonable conduct of a friend. But I have often noticed
the most melancholy irritability in others, and have wondered why
they gave way to it, and what it portended. Now I know. I have
been reading the <i>Medical Press and Courier</i>, and I learn from it that
"this hyperæsthesia of the temper is the direct outcome of overwork
and want of sleep; in fact, it is a morbid sensitiveness of the
cells of the cerebral cortex due to exhaustion or under-nutrition.
Irritability is, therefore a clinical sign of some importance, the more
so because it is often the premonitory indication of impending
breakdown. Under these circumstances, the condition is usually
most marked during the forenoon, and is associated with a distaste
for food at breakfast time. Later on, even the humanising effect of
a good lunch fails to raise circulatory activity to the standard
required for adequate cerebral nutrition, and the irritability becomes
chronic, yielding only to the influence of repeated doses of a diffusible
stimulant, such as brandy and soda. The remedy naturally only
aggravates the symptom, which is sooner or later followed by other
manifestations of cerebral exhaustion."</p>

<p>There have been some difficulties at Brierly Hill. At a recent
meeting of the Urban Council a letter was read from the Local
Government Board asking for information with regard to a communication
which Dr. <span class="sc">Ellis</span>, the medical officer of health, had
addressed to them. This referred to the fact that Dr. <span class="sc">Ellis</span> had
ordered a "dumb" well at the Town Hall to be cleared out.
What is the use of a dumb well? Even if it contains the truth
it cannot speak it. Personally, I prefer a babbling brook.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>What is this? Is it a revolution or merely a mistake? Do I
sleep, do I dream, or is visions about? These questions occur to me
on reading that at Ironbridge the other day a
clown, a member of a circus, was brought up on
remand charged with stealing £1 10s. and several
articles, the property of his landlady. And he was
actually sentenced to fourteen days' hard labour.
All I can say is that I have rarely allowed a year
to pass without seeing at least one clown steal a
string of sausages, a lady's bonnet, two plump
babies, half a dozen fowls, the greater part of a
general dealer's property, and the upper half of a
policeman. Nobody bothered him about it. In
fact, everybody expected him to do it, and there
would have been great dissatisfaction if he had observed the laws
against larceny. And yet when a clown at Ironbridge acts as
clowns are intended to act, an unfeeling bench visits him with a
fortnight of hard labour. This is preposterous. There ought to
be an Amalgamated Union of Clowns to protect its members from
such an outrage.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Those who study the reports of meetings of Town Councils learn
many things. For instance, at Bristol the other day, during a discussion
of passenger tolls at the docks, Mr. <span class="sc">Gore</span> complained that
they had been hocussed by the chairman of the sub-committee that
day. Mr. <span class="sc">Baker</span> objected to the word "hocussed" being applied to
him, but added that they had been hocussed out of a good deal of
time to-day, and Mr. <span class="sc">Gore</span> retorted that they were going to be
hocussed out of another quarter-of-an-hour yet. Mr. <span class="sc">Baker</span> asked
Mr. <span class="sc">Gore</span> to withdraw the word, and Mr. <span class="sc">Gore</span> refused. Matters
had apparently come to a desperate pass, when it occurred to the
Mayor to inquire what the word "hocussed" meant. Mr. <span class="sc">Baker</span>
thought it was something akin to cheating, whereupon Mr. <span class="sc">Gore</span>, in
the handsomest manner, said that knowing the meaning of the word
he would now withdraw it. The only thing that was not explained
was why Mr. <span class="sc">Gore</span> had used a word of the meaning of which he was
ignorant. There is a fatal attraction about the sound of certain
words which forces speakers to use them entirely without regard to
their actual meaning.</p>

<h3 class="sans">A TRIP "PER SEA."</h3>

<p class="ind2"><i>Projected Re-visitation</i>&mdash;<i>Ilfracombe</i>&mdash;<i>Torrs Walks</i>&mdash;<i>En route</i>&mdash;<i>Start</i>&mdash;<i>In
Dock</i>&mdash;<i>Out</i>&mdash;<i>Tender Thoughts</i>&mdash;<i>On Board</i>&mdash;Reception&mdash;<i>Greetings</i>&mdash;<i>Exciting
Search</i>&mdash;<i>Parting</i>&mdash;<i>Off!</i></p>

<p><i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;Revisit Ilfracombe. Hire highest possible house
at the lowest possible price close to celebrated "Torrs Walks."
Why called "Torrs Walks"? Probably original <span class="sc">Torrs</span> who discovered
Ilfracombe used to walk here; one stormy night <span class="sc">Torrs</span> lost
his head and legs; then fell from sheer height of several hundred
feet into boiling sea; boiling sea made it hot for the unhappy <span class="sc">Torrs</span>;
<span class="sc">Torrs</span> only walking, not swimming. Therefore end of <span class="sc">Torrs</span>.
Family name perpetuated in Walks. Years ago, price to ascend Torrs
was one penny per head, body included. Tariff gone up since then.
To Torrs Torr-tuous Turnings admission Twopence. Extra penny
might have improved paths. Here there is as much "winding up" as
in bankruptcy. "<i>Excelsior</i>" is motto of visitor; likewise of proprietor
who put on the extra penny. No matter; not another
spot in England where pedestrian can get better air, better exercise,
and finer views, all for twopence!</p>

<p><i>Friendly Advice&mdash;gratis.</i>&mdash;Always carry waterproof. If practicable
get someone to carry it for you. Never know when you may
want it, or when you mayn't. Stop for five o'clock tea on Torrs top.
Whistle merrily "<i>Torr-eador contento</i>" as you descend, and you
will be giving one of the best airs in <i>Carmen</i> in return for about
the finest air in Devonshire.</p>

<p><i>How to get to Ilfracombe.</i>&mdash;Per rail, London and South-Western.
Picturesque line of country. Another, and a longer <i>route</i>, per <i>mare
et terram</i>, and therefore more varied and health-refreshing, which
are important points to score if your holiday be circumscribed, is to
take passage on board steamer, Pacific Orient Line for choice, which
stops at Plymouth <i>en route</i> to give a last glance at Old England
before proceeding across the Bay of Biscay to Naples, and, ultimately,
Australia. Only drawback to this is the start from Fenchurch Street.
Fenchurch Street Station enough to make anyone start. Wanted
here a spacious, light and airy place where passengers carrying "hand
properties" can move about rapidly without loss of that equanimity of
temper which every traveller should cultivate under circumstances that
would try even the joviality of that utterly impossible creation <i>Mark
Tapley</i>. Still <i>Mark Tapley</i> is an ideal to be lived up to as near as
may be; and the passenger who, with bag in hand, while struggling
with mixed crowd in Fenchurch Street Station on the departure of any
important Tilbury Dock train, can be jovial or even ordinarily polite,
is already in a fair way towards earning the Ideal Tapley Medal.</p>

<p>Tilbury Wharf. "And at this wharf of Tilbury" why not more
porters? Why not a covering to the landing-stage, where at present,
the traveller, like the sky parlour in ancient song, "exposed to the
wind and the rain," will be thoroughly drenched while awaiting the
advent of the tender. <i>Happy Thought.</i>&mdash;To-day, fortunately, fine.</p>

<p>These queries occur to me as I stand on this floating quay, and
witness in the distance the "tender parting." There will be many
"a tender parting" beside this one to be seen when the <i>Orotava</i> gets
her steam up, and quits Tilbury for Melbourne.</p>

<p>We board the <i>Orotava</i>, which is to board and lodge so many of
them (with another contingent going overland, and joining the ship
later on) for the next month or so.</p>

<p>I am personally introduced to the captain by some kindly friends
who come to see me off, and whom, as I lose sight of them in the
crowd, it is soon my turn to "see off"; as subsequently I can only
catch a glimpse of them in the crowd, on the tender, as they depart
for shore, when we wave hands to one another implying thereby all
sorts of good wishes. After making the captain's acquaintance, I am
introduced by some light-hearted companion&mdash;everyone on board is
either boisterously gay or in the deepest grief&mdash;to a good-humoured-looking
portly gentleman, whom, there being nothing whatever nautical
in his appearance, I should have taken for a landed proprietor,
"one of the olden time," had I not very soon discovered him to be
something uncommonly superior in the Nautical Pacific Service, and
<i>the</i> friend in need, without whom no passenger's happiness is complete,
that is, speaking from practical experience, if the destination
of that passenger is only Plymouth, as was mine.</p>

<p><i>Farewell!</i> The tender is about to depart. It seems to me to be as
full as when it arrived. "Cheers, tears and laughter:" only the
laughter is a bit forced, while the tears are natural, and the cheers
most hearty. The tender hesitates. Tug evidently tender-hearted;
can't bear to part with the good ship <i>Orotava</i>. No; this is not the
cause of the delay. Some one is waited for. Tender crew impatient.
Where is he? Who is he? Find him. Some one, in ordinary frock
coat and top hat but clearly an official on board tender, puts both
hands to his month and shouts out what sounds to me like "Wait for
Mister <span class="sc">Tubbs</span>!" Evidently tender cannot go ashore without
<span class="sc">Tubbs</span>;
equally evident that <span class="sc">Tubbs</span> is not to sail with the <i>Orotava</i>.
Puzzle,
to find <span class="sc">Tubbs</span>. Stewards, chief officers, mates, men rush in all
directions
to rout out <span class="sc">Tubbs</span>. Look-out man aloft in sort of suspended
clothes basket cannot get a sight of <span class="sc">Tubbs</span> either in the offing or out
of it. Nothing like <span class="sc">Tubbs</span> to be seen anywhere. Somebody reports
at top of voice "He's with the captain." Captain up above somewhere,
invisible, denies soft impeachment as to being cognisant of
the whereabouts of <span class="sc">Tubbs</span>. What is <span class="sc">Tubbs</span> doing? Playing hide
and seek? Search light turned on into darkest and deepest depths
of <i>Orotava</i>. No <span class="sc">Tubbs</span>. Suddenly first gangway withdrawn, and
grasp of tender partially relaxed. Exciting moment. Crew of
tender rattle second gangway threateningly: their patience is
almost exhausted. The cry goes up once more for <span class="sc">Tubbs</span> ahoy!
Even the weeping wives and sorrowing friends, lovers and children
forget their dear ones for a moment and strain their eyes in every
direction, gasping for a glimpse of invisible <span class="sc">Tubbs</span>. At last a small,
stoutish figure appears on the gangway. Is he hatless? breathless?
Not a bit of it. He walks the gangway as if he yet had hours of
leisure before him, and was quite unconscious of having kept anyone
waiting. It is <span class="sc">Tubbs</span> himself. The self-possession of <span class="sc">Tubbs</span> is
remarkable,
nay admirable. He notices nobody. Speaks to nobody. Suddenly
he disappears; the gangway is withdrawn; more cheers, more waving
of pocket-handkerchiefs, and the tender, with the impassive <span class="sc">Tubbs</span>
to boot, drifts out of sight, and the <i>Orotava</i> is fairly under weigh.</p>

<p class="ind">A wedding of great interest to Welsh

<hr class="medium" />

<h2>THE LATEST DANGER.</h2>

<p class="title1">(<i>A Caution to those who are Interviewed.</i>)</p>

<p>The celebrity awaited his interviewer with
some impatience. He had arranged his story
with considerable care. He was prepared to
show that he was the best of boys at school,
the most studious of students at the university,
the worthiest of men at all times. He
felt sure that when the record of his life was
published, preparations would be made to
erect a statue and a glass window in his
honour. And so he was satisfied.</p>

<p>In due course the interviewer appeared.
The man was bland and persuasive. He
requested the celebrity to take a chair, and
then placed his hand upon his brow. The
celebrity gazed into the eyes of his visitor
with a lack lustre stare, and then seemingly
sank into a heavy sleep.</p>

<p>"And now I am prepared to begin," murmured
the interviewer, taking out his notebook.
"My worthy Sir, I command you to
tell me all. Mark you well&mdash;all."
And then the celebrity, in a monotonous
tone, revealed the secrets of the past.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The celebrity was furious. The interview
had appeared, and was far too true in the
story of its subject's life to be pleasant.
There was no assertion that the celebrity had
been the best of boys at school, the most
studious of students at the university, the
worthiest of men at all times. On the contrary,
the celebrity had "come out" in rather
unflattering colours. So that eminent man
was simply furious. He had sent for his interviewer,
and awaited once more his arrival
with impatience. In due course his biographer
turned up.</p>

<p>"And now, Sir," said the celebrity, in
tones trembling with anger, "what do you
mean by suggesting that I tried as a child to
slaughter my maiden aunt?"</p>

<p>"Did you?" was the calm rejoinder.</p>

<p>"That is beside the question. And why
did you assert that I had told you that I
never did a day's work at the university?"</p>

<p>"But you did say so&mdash;didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Again beside the question. And what
did you mean by stating that I had deserted
my wife, and turned my children out-of-doors
at a moment's notice?"</p>

<p>"But were those statements true or
untrue?"</p>

<p>"That you have not received a writ for
libel is my answer. But how came you to
know these unpleasant details&mdash;who told
you?"</p>

<p>"You did."</p>

<p>"I did! When, where and how?"</p>

<p>"When I saw you here, and at my request."</p>

<p>"I do not understand you," murmured the
puzzled celebrity. "Why should I tell you
all this?"</p>

<p>Then came the explanation.</p>

<p>"You told me all I wanted," replied the
interviewer, "because I am a hypnotist?"</p>

<p>"Indeed!" returned the celebrity when
he had recovered from his astonishment; and
then, after a moment of deep consideration,
he gave his visitor the names and addresses
of the more hated of his rivals.</p>

<h2 class="sans">ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p class="title1">EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, August 12.</i>&mdash;"Are you ready?
Go!" No mistaking the voice. It was the clear, sharp notes of
<span class="sc">Hemprer Joe</span>, ringing from behind <span class="sc">Speaker's</span> Chair, high above
buzz of talk and bustle of movement in crowded House. Wondering
what it might portend, when discovered <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> and
<span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span> entering simultaneously, after the fashion of
the Bounding Brothers from the Breathless Baltic. Only, if you
remember, those eminent <i>artistes</i> appeared in ring from directly
opposite approaches, advancing towards each other with startling,
though graceful evolutions. <span class="sc">Prince</span> and <span class="sc">Squire</span>, on contrary,
started from door at back of <span class="sc">Speaker's</span> Chair, advanced fair toe
and heel to table; walked step by step together along either
front bench, till each reached the seat kept vacant for him.</p>

<p>House so surprised at this performance it almost forgot to shout.
What usually happens on like occasions is for one Leader of
Party to take his seat amid loud cheers from his friends, taken up
with strident voice from other side when their man comes in. Now
cheers, if indulged in, would mingle, and might be misunderstood. A
welcome meant for <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> might seem to be bestowed upon
<span class="sc">Squire</span>, and <i>vice versâ</i>, as Mr. <span class="sc">Anstey</span> once said. Whilst
perturbed
House looked on, <span class="sc">Hemprer Joe</span>, having watched his men, fairly
started, reach their goal, followed with swinging step and the
inevitable orchid.</p>

<p>To see him seat himself on Treasury Bench, the right-hand man
of a Tory Government, too much for the feelings of <span class="sc">Tim Healy</span>,
usually held in stern reserve. During interval of General Election
<span class="sc">Tim</span> been holding sweet converse with his colleagues in general,
<span class="sc">Blake</span> and <span class="sc">Tay Pay</span> in particular. By odd chance he, taking his
place in new Parliament to-day, found himself seated between his
two friends, to whom presently entered the "dear <span class="sc">Justin</span>" of a
voluminous missive. Soothed by such companionship <span class="sc">Tim</span> in melting
mood. But sight of <span class="sc">Hemprer Joe</span> finally crossing the gangway,
formally completing marvellous journey from Birmingham to
Hatfield, too much for trained equanimity. <span class="sc">Tim</span> groaned aloud.
<span class="sc">Swift MacNeill</span> roared as if in anguish. Dr. <span class="sc">Tanner</span>
(figuratively
of course) cut himself with knives, emitting sounds that nearly
frightened to death two new members seated on either side of him.
<span class="sc">l'Hemprer</span> smiled benignly. Clerk at Table, dexterously interposing,
pointed spectral forefinger at <span class="sc">John Mowbray</span>, who rose to
"move that the Right Hon. <span class="sc">William Court Gully</span> do take the
Chair as Speaker."</p>

<p>A delicate task, seeing that a few short months back he had run
<span class="sc">White Ridley</span> for the Chair against the man whose price to-day he
fixed far above rubies. Admirably performed; made easier by fact
that meanwhile <span class="sc">Gully</span> had filled the Chair, acquitting himself in
manner that justified choice of friends and extorted admiration on
other side.</p>

<p>"All very well," says <span class="sc">Sark</span>, "to talk about preserving cherished
traditions and best precedents of House. But suppose <span class="sc">Gully</span> had
been&mdash;I won't say a failure, but&mdash;anything short of perfect manner
in the Chair, where would he have been to-day?"</p>

<p>Certainly not in the Chair, whither <span class="sc">Mowbray</span> led him, escorted by
<span class="sc">John Ellis</span>, and where <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> welcomed him in terms
which indicated that now was the dearest desire of his heart fulfilled.
As for <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span>, he was so affected that he fell into his
most funereal manner.</p>

<p>"One would think," said <span class="sc">Chaplin</span>, himself in the highest spirits,
"that he had come to bury <span class="sc">Gully</span>, not to praise him."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Speaker</span> re-elected.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;"Our army may have sworn terribly in Flanders," said
Mr. <span class="sc">Milman</span>, tossing back the wig from his throbbing brow and
rearranging
his crumpled gown; "it was nothing to what the House
of Commons can do when called upon."</p>

<p>Four o'clock now. House met at noon, and ever since they've
been swearing away. <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> and <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span> led
off, in company with <span class="sc">Hicks-Beach</span>, <span class="sc">Goschen</span> and <span class="sc">Henry
Fowler</span>.
He no longer the Great Mogul. Has folded up his turban, put away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg 96]</span>
his kaftan, hung up his yataghan, and once more
resumed the dress of commonplace Englishman.
House loses something of its picturesqueness. But, <span class="sc">Fowler</span>
says, change of estate has some compensations. At
least now he has not to receive the <span class="sc">Shahzada</span> in his
family circle, handing him round tea and cakes, and
attempting to converse with him in the Afghan tongue,
imperfectly acquired by study of <span class="sc">Ollendorf</span>. Sense
of renewed freedom made Ex-Secretary for India
throw added fervour into his bout of swearing.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;"><a href="images/096a-580.png"><img src="images/096a-200.png" width="200" height="420" alt="The Elect of Whitehaven!" /></a>
<p>The Elect of Whitehaven!</p>

<p><i>A-g-st-s H-ld-r, Esq., M.P</i>. "Well really,
now they come to mention it, the likeness between
myself and Sir William Harcourt is
<i>very remarkable indeed!</i>"</p></div>

<p>A little excitement at first
in crowded House. No reason
why Members should
insist on being sworn-in
right away. Might look in
later in afternoon, when
pressure was over; or call
to-morrow; or stroll in all
by themselves on Thursday
or Friday. Human instinct
irrepressible even in Members
of Parliament. Must
be in the first flight, whatever
is going on. So swarmed
round table, made dashes
for stray copies of the New
Testament, snatched at slices
of cardboard containing form
of oath, as the anonymous
drowning man clutched at
the fortuitous straw. <span class="sc">Milman</span>,
standing at table, administering
oath, had a hot
time of it for an hour. Thereafter excitement began to tone
down, and just now flickered out.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Swearing in
Members.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;"Accidental relations
in directorial capacity with
a great railway corporation have,"
said <span class="sc">David Plunket</span>, "brought
to my knowledge the fact that
when signals on the line show a
green light, caution is necessary.
This afternoon, when I observed
<span class="sc">Tanner</span> come in with flaming
green necktie I feared the worst."</p>

<p>The worst didn't befall till midnight
approached. But things in
immediate neighbourhood of <span class="sc">Tanner</span>
been seething for some time.
His topographical position a little
trying. Faced by triumphant
majority of anti-Home-Rulers,
distinctly seeing on Treasury
Bench two <span class="sc">Balfours</span> where formerly
only one had sat, he was
irritated by having on his flank
the <span class="sc">Redmond</span> <i>frères</i>, <span class="sc">Harrington</span>,
<span class="sc">Clancy</span> and other compatriots
almost worse than <span class="sc">Saxons</span>,
not to mention the pain to a man
of peace of consciousness that
between his friends and colleagues
<span class="sc">Tim Healy</span> and <span class="sc">John Dillon</span>
there was something lacking in
the way of perfect loving-kindness.
Then there was <span class="sc">Boanerges
Russell</span> on the Treasury Bench.
Bad enough to have had him sitting
on corner of top bench immediately
opposite. To see him
curling up his legs on Treasury
Bench, one of Her Majesty's
Ministers, drawing a salary quarterly
with regulation and despatch,
was more than a humble but patriotic medical practitioner could stand.
"<span class="sc">T. W. Russell!</span>" cried <span class="sc">Tanner</span>, with fine irony, and bold
disregard
of Parliamentary usage, which forbids mention of Members by
name. The observation was by way of postscript to inquiry as to
whether the Government really intend to try and prevent the murder
of any more missionaries in China, and bring in an Irish Land Bill?</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;"><a href="images/096b-660.png"><img src="images/096b-200.png" width="200" height="213" alt="A Piece of Crown-Derby Ware!" /></a>
<p>A Piece of Crown-Derby Ware!</p>

<p>Design for Bemrose-and-Drage Ornament for the
Chimney-piece. No publican's parlour should be
without this charming memento of a great victory.</p></div>

<p>No satisfaction forthcoming on these points. <span class="sc">Tanner</span> sat and
brooded by the hour over fresh wrongs of
Ireland, complicated by these proceedings
in China. It was <span class="sc">Harrington</span> who accidentally
and unintentionally dropped the spark which, as
a Member once observed, let slip the
dogs of war. "That's a lie!" remarked
<span class="sc">Tanner</span>, by way of criticising one of
<span class="sc">Harrington's</span> statements.
Remark made in quite ordinary
way; just as if he had been moved to
say "How d' you do?" or, "It's a
fine day." Friends and countrymen sitting
near not in slightest degree disturbed.
Only <span class="sc">Tanner's</span>
way. <span class="sc">Harrington</span>, in fact, had commenced next sentence,
when voice of long-suffering <span class="sc">Speaker</span> heard, inquiring whether he
had heard aright, one Member accusing another of being a liar?</p>

<p><span class="sc">Tanner</span> a little flustered at this extraordinary and unexpected
punctilio. If objection taken had not been so sudden, the Doctor,
most amiable and good-natured of men, who wouldn't hurt a fly
much less flout a <span class="sc">Speaker</span>, would have apologised. But House
angrily roared; <span class="sc">Speaker</span> remained standing; <span class="sc">Hemprer Joe</span>,
leading
House in temporary absence of <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>, appeared on scene
with bit of paper he had in his pocket, containing, by rare chance,
written formula for moving suspension
of disorderly Member. So
<span class="sc">Tanner</span> was "named," and presently
escorted from House by
Deputy-Sergeant-at-Arms,
shaking his fist at unoffending
Secretary for the Colonies, shouting
"Judas! Judas!" at top of
strident voice, probably restrained
only by general hurry of proceedings
from demonstrating how
<span class="sc">L'Hemprer</span> was at bottom of
the murder of missionaries in
China.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Address
moved. So was <span class="sc">Tanner</span>&mdash;out of
House. <span class="sc">Robertson</span>, M.P. for
South Hackney, delightful in
seconding Address. Confided to
House that he was first genuine
East-Ender ever placed in such
position.</p>

<p><i>As he was</i>. The Seconder of the Address. <i>As he ought to
have been</i>.</p>

<p>"Hon. Members would probably be interested in seeing what a dweller in the
East End was really like, especially when he was to be in some costume suitable
to the occasion."</p></div>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Unprecedented scene
to-night. <span class="sc">Attorney-General
for Ireland</span>, rising from Treasury
Bench, opposed <span class="sc">John Dillon's</span>
amendment to Address;
<span class="sc">Solicitor-General for Ireland</span>,
springing up from Front Opposition
Bench, warmly supported it.
Both maiden speeches; manner
distinctly different. <span class="sc">Atkinson</span>
prim, severe, official; <span class="sc">Hemphill</span>
friendly, genial, richly eloquent.</p>

<p>"I fancy," said <span class="sc">Prince
Arthur</span>, with one of his sweet
smiles, "our <span class="sc">Solicitor-General</span>
has studied his Parliamentary
manner by observing the graces of
a popular conductor on taking his
seat in the orchestra." <i>Business
done.</i>&mdash;Still debating Address.</p>
